# HIV_phylogenetic_tree

In 2002 DNA testing was used in the court to determine whether the gastroenterologist was guilty of attempting second-degree murder by injecting his former girlfriend with a object containing blood contaminated with HIV-1.  The result achieved by phylogenetic analysis were presented at testifying. Since that time molecular investigation of diseases have been used at a verified testify in courts. 

Today with the use of Seaview and PhylML I am going to determine on dataset coming from Pubmed record http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12388776 whether the hypothesis of gastroenterologist have been guilty of infecting his former girlfriend with HIV-1.

The dataset contained 30 randomly chosen HIV patients in Lafayette, 4 sequences from victim and other gastroenterologistâ€™s HIV-positive patients.
The analysis were performed with different level of bootstrap: 50, 100, 150, 200, 500 and 1000.
